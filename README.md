# <center>Extractor

Extractor library is useful to help the user download any kind of Images at any date and time over the internet. These images will get downloaded as a job and then let user know that the images have been downloaded.

## <center>Appendix

There are often a times, we need bunch images to work. We can consider the example such as training the Machine learning model over the Cat and Dog images or having those hundreds of beautiful desktop/mobile wallpaper on our laptop with just single click. In such scenario‚Äôs we need hundreds of images right away. This problem can be solved using the Extractor Library. The following use cases can be implemented: 
  
## <center>Features

- Upto 2000 images on single click
- Cross platform

## <center>Run Locally

### To download the Extractor, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.

```bash
pip install ImageExtractor
```

### Using it

```python
from ImageExtractor.Extractor import ImageExtractorClass

image_extractor = ImageExtractorClass()
image_extractor.schedule_job('sample_search_query', 'YY-MM-DD', 'HH:MM', 100)

And you are ready to go! At this point, at the given date and time, the images will start downloading.

<li>It is scalable as many users can request for images at the same time.</li>
